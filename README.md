    username VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY, 
    password_ VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL);
Click Go.


Click new again and add a table named events. toggle the sql button and add the create table code for the events table. 
after ward, to add in the data values, go on the users table and back to the sql button then copy and paste one data value ex)
